# Question

´Some
employees have remarked to the boss that they are working more than other
employees. Your boss has decided to study the matter by asking all employees to
describe exactly what they are doing. If some jobs are found to be overly
demanding, your boss may redistribute job tasks or hire additional employees.


´Your task.
Write a well organized email describing your duties, the time you spend on each
task, and the skills needed for what you do. Provide enough details to make a
clear record of your job. Use actual names and describe actual tasks. Describe
a current or previous job. If you have not worked, report to the head of an
organization to which you belong. Describe the duties of an officer or of a
committee. Your boss or organization head appreciates brevity. Keep your email
very precise and under one page.
